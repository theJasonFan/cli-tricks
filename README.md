Unorganized assortment of CLI / unix tricks that I want to remember

## Programs

- `rs` - reshape a data array

## Rust
This might spawn off into it's own doc...
- `cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic -W clippy::nursery` for most annoying 
    pedantic lints. 
    Use `clippy::cargo` to lint cargo  manifest.
- `#![deny(missing_docs]` and `#![deny(missing_debug_implementations]` for starters;
    check rustc and rustdoc lints if you want more.

## Misc
- rename a channel on keybase 
    `keybase chat rename-channel <team> <old-channel-name> <new-channel-name>`
